# Introduction
Guessify is a web-based game application built with React and NodeJS. Users can connect and play with their Spotify accounts by logging in and selecting a playlist to use. They can then choose to create or join a new game where they play through various rounds with other users while guessing whose playlist the currently queued song belongs to. Players are assigned points based on correct guesses with a leaderboard displaying the winner when an endgame state has been triggered.

Interfacing with Spotify's services and API allows for optimal user experience and ease of access.

# System Architecture
This system utilizes the client-server architecture model. In this model, the client or user typically initiates communication with the server by sending a request for a resource or service. The server then processes the request and sends the requested resource back to the client-side. This model provides a number of benefits, including improved scalability, easier maintenance and management, and enhanced security.

The following diagram demonstrates this architecture flow while depicting the front-end's nested React component nature. Conditional rendering is utilized within the front-end subcomponents to control UI flow, with each component providing a certain function whether that being communication with an API or collecting data to send as props.
